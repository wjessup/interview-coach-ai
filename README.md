# interview-coach-ai

This app shows how ChatGPT can be used to generate helpful feedback and coaching for people taking job interviews.

This application will analyze a question asked by the hiring manager, the response given by the candidate, and information about what coursework and challenges the candidate has solved to provide feedback and a suggested response. 

I wrote this app to help [MeritAmerica](https://meritamerica.org/), a non-profit that helps re-train adults in tech careers. I was told that often the first time the learners in MeritAmerica's program have ever used zoom is in the training. It's not a surprise then that people who have passed coursework will be unconfident in their skills, nervous, and struggle to market their skills accordingly in a job interview. 

The default question and answer were provided to me by MeritAmerica as a typical example. The app does a pretty good job at recommending a better answer!

The next step would be to review actual interviews from the candidate and automatically review and create response suggestions.
